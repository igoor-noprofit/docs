If you're using IGOOR with software such as TD Control by Tobii, you can set up a small trick to avoid a lot of extra clicks.

**IMPORTANT: The IGOOR association is NOT affiliated with Tobii / Dynavox.**

Indeed, in TD Control, by default, every time you want to interact with a button, TD Control asks you what type of action you want to perform (e.g. left click, right click, drag and drop, etc.)

However, everything inside the IGOOR software is done with the left click.

Here are some tips:

To enable/disable continuous clicking in TD Control, it's the button to the right of the pause button (in the off-screen menu): it's a + surrounded by two circular arrows.

By default, it allows you to repeat the left click, click and drag, and hold and drag.

If nothing happens, the function might be disabled. In the menu, go to Settings, then Customize, Continuous Mode, and choose Click on Fixation.

Here, you can also add another button.

For your information, there is also **a Repeated mode that allows you to:**

- **enable/disable the left click only**
    
- **hover without clicking**
    
- **hide the gaze trail**
