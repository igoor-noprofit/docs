IGOOR provides four tools to help the person affected by a communication disorder (the USER) to better communicate with their surroundings (the INTERLOCUTORS):

- [[2 - Daily Needs]]
- [[3 - Dialogue with the Interlocutor]]
- [[4 - Automatic Input]]
- [[5 - Quick Buttons]]

These communication tools ALL rely on a CONTEXT that systematically includes:

- The **ONGOING CONVERSATION**
- **The time**, the location, and the weather (if the weather extension is enabled)
- **The patient's health condition**
- **Information about the patient's life provided by the patient themselves**
- **Information learned by the machine** as it is used, stored in its **SHORT-TERM MEMORY** (lasting 2 weeks) **and/or LONG-TERM MEMORY**
- A short definition of the **patient's style** to guide the AI's writing (**SETTINGS > BIO**)
