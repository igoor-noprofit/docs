Long-term memory gathers all the information about you or your loved ones that consists of facts, relationships, or stable preferences.  
For example:

"Pierre adores Tarantino's cinema"

is a stable preference.

"On the other hand, 'Pierre went to see a Tarantino movie this afternoon' is information for short-term memory."

Facts, opinions, preferences, etc., must be validated by the AI before they can be integrated into long-term memory.
