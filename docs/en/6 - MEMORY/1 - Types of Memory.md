IGOOR has three types of memory:

- [[2 - Extracted Memory from Your Documents]] (manual, static)
- [[3 - Long-term memory]] (automatic, incremental)
- [[4 - Short-term memory]] (automatic, dynamic)

These memories are used differently to customize the software's predictions:

- the first one is provided by you
- the other two are automatically added by the AI based on your conversations through the IGOOR software
