You can automatically extract information about yourself from documents containing significant information about your life.

IGOOR accepts the following formats:

- **PDF** (extension .pdf)
- **Text** (extension .txt)
- **Markdown** (extension .md)

Other formats might be added in future versions.

## Web tool for recording biographical memory

At the beginning, **IGOOR has no information about you, apart from the mandatory information such as your first name, health status, etc.** It is therefore difficult for IGOOR to understand friendship and family relationships, and many other pieces of information about you.

We can help you create a document filled with this kind of significant information through a web form that you can fill in either with your voice (automatically transcribed) or using the keyboard.

## Integration of documents

In this beta version, **you must manually move the documents you want to integrate into a specific folder** so that the application will include them in the memory at the next launch.

IGOOR creates a folder on your computer at the first launch, in C:\Users or C:\Utilisateurs. If your username is "pierre", for example, you will have to put your documents in:

C:\Users\pierre\AppData\Roaming\igoor\plugins\rag\medias

or

C:\Utilisateurs\pierre\AppData\Roaming\igoor\plugins\rag\medias

The application keeps track of the documents you have already integrated into the memory. If in the future you want to add other documents, it will be enough to move them into the folder. **The integration will take place at the next launch of the IGOOR application.**

## Tips

The AI will do its best to "understand" the information in your documents. However, it is recommended to use frequent repetitions of the subject in your texts to avoid attribution problems, for example:

%% Pierre is Jean-Marc's son-in-law. Jean-Marc's wife is named Julie. Julie and Jean-Marc live in Nancy. %%

To test that IGOOR takes your predictions into account correctly, you can for example use auto-completion. In the example above, by typing for example:

Jean-Marc lives...

The predictions should include for example " in Nancy with Julie".
