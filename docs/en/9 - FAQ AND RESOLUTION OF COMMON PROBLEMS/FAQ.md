## General
**Q: What is IGOOR?**
A: IGOOR is an open-source conversational application, operable via mouse or eye-tracking commands, designed for people with communication impairments, including ALS.

**Q: Is IGOOR free?** 
A: **IGOOR is free, open-source, and libre software**. However, some of its features currently depend on third-party providers that offer paid subscriptions. 
**IMPORTANT: IGOOR is affiliated with NONE of these providers.**

**Q: Where are my memories stored?**
**A: Your memories are stored on your computer.** However, to provide context to the AI that generates your predictions, they must be sent to the AI provider. You can find more information about Groq, the open-source AI provider we have chosen, here: [[2 - Preferences - AI]]

**Q: Where is my cloned voice stored?**
A: To clone your voice, cloud services such as Speechify or Elevenlabs require audio samples that you send to them (outside of the IGOOR application). Only people with access to your account with these providers can generate sentences using your cloned voice. The API key for accessing your accounts is also stored on your computer so that IGOOR can use it.
