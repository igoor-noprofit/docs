Click on the installer and allow installation from an unknown source

### Installation of third-party components

IGOOR relies on FFMPEG and a Microsoft component called Edge WebView2 Runtime.
If they are already installed on your computer, you will see this box:

![edge_already_installed.png](../assets/edge_already_installed.png)

Otherwise, the installer will continue to install them on your machine.
Follow the instructions for their installation.

### License

You must then accept the IGOOR license:

![setup license](../assets/setup_license.png)


Next, choose the folder where to install IGOOR if you want (or leave the default folder).
You can then choose where the software will appear in the Windows Start menu:

![start menu](../assets/start_menu.png)


Then check the box to create a shortcut on the desktop:

![additional_tasks](../assets/additional_tasks.png)

The summary prompts you to finalize the installation by clicking on "Install":

![ready to install](../assets/ready_to_install.png)


The software starts the installation:

![ready to install](../assets/ready_to_install.png)


![ready to install](../assets/extracting_files.png)
At the end of the installation, you can directly start IGOOR.

## Common installation troubleshooting

1. IGOOR is not registered with Microsoft as a software publisher. SmartScreen may therefore prevent you from starting the installation process at all and display this popup:

**SOLUTION: Click on "More information" and then "Run anyway"

2. At the end of the installation process, launching the application may fail due to a false positive. A popup opens and informs you that the application has been recognized as a virus.

**SOLUTION: Run the software installation as administrator**
