## Benefits
Cloning one's voice has obvious advantages for the user and their surroundings: a voice that matches the person.

If the user has the ability to use their own voice, it is possible to make recordings to clone it. If not, but you have samples of the user's voice, you can clone it from these samples. In this latter case, however, you will need to cut out the parts that do not correspond to the user's voice.

In both cases, it is possible to create an **instant voice clone** (which requires about **1 minute of the user's voice recording**) or a **professional clone** (which may require up to **three hours of recordings**).

Refer to this page on the IGOOR website for advice on recording your voice and if you would like to be accompanied during the voice recording process:
