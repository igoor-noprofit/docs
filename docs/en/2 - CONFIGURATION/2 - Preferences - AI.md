To use IGOOR predictions, you need an API key from the AI provider Groq.

**IMPORTANT: We are neither partners nor affiliated with Groq. Other providers may be added in the future.**

Today, we use the models offered by the Groq provider for the following advantages:

- Speed ([Groq is a chip manufacturer](https://groq.com/lpu-architecture))
- [Privacy compliance](https://groq.com/privacy-policy/) (their servers are located in Europe)
- Groq does not use data to train its models, as it [supports open-source and open-weights models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
- [An extremely competitive pricing model](https://groq.com/pricing)
