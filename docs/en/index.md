**IGOOR** is a conversational application that is **open-source and free**, and can also be controlled by eye-tracking, designed to provide people with diseases that affect communication a means of communication as smooth and natural as possible.

**IGOOR** is developed by the no-profit [IGOOR association (1901 law)](https://igoor.org){target=blank}, in partnership with the [ARSLA association](https://arsla.org){target=blank}. The original idea for this application comes from Igor Novitzki, founder of the association.

The application is currently in testing phase at the [Hôpital Marin d'Hendaye](https://www.aphp.fr/hopitaux/hendaye){target=blank}, with people suffering from diseases such as ALS and LGS. IGOOR already takes into account the first feedbacks from its users.
